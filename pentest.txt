1. Planning and preparation
    Identification of contact individuals from both side,
    Opening meeting to confirm the scope, approach, and methodology, and
    Agree to specific test cases and escalation paths.

2. Assessment
Information Gathering: Using the Internet to find all information about the target, using both technical and nontechnical methods.
    Network Mapping: Identifying all systems and resources within the target network.
    Vulnerability Identification: Activities performed by the assessor to detect vulnerabilities in the target.
    Penetration: Gaining unauthorized access by circumventing the security measures in place and trying to reach as wide a level of access as possible.
    Gaining Access and Privilege Escalation: After successfully exploiting a target system or network, the assessor will try to gain higher level privileges.
    Enumerating Further: Obtaining additional information about processes on the system, with the goal of further exploiting a compromised network or system.
    Compromise Remote Users/Sites: Exploit the trust relationships and communication between remote users and enterprise networks.
    Maintaining Access: Using covert channels, back doors, and rootkits to hide the assessorâ€™s presence on the system or to provide continual access to the compromised system.
    Covering Tracks: Eliminate all signs of compromise by hiding files, clearing logs, defeating integrity checks, and defeating antivirus software.
