Network security assessment
    Reconnaissance: Identify networks, hosts, and users of interest
    Vulnerability scanning: Identify potentially exploitable conditions
    Investigation of vulnerabilities and further probing by hand
    Exploitation of vulnerabilities and circumvention of security mechanism
    Elevation of privileges, pivoting, recurse.

Penetration Testing

Terminology
    **Asset**: component that supports information activites that should be protected
    **Vulnerability** weakness that can be used to gain access to an asset
    **Threat** danger to the system that can allow the compromise of an asset
    **Exploit** program/script used to exploit a vulnerability and compromise an asset
    **Risk** impact resulting from compromising an asset
    **Vulnerability assessment** Process of finding all the vulnerabilities
    **Penetration test** exploit all the vulnerabilities

Botnet and C&C design
    Clients use TLS port 443 to connect to the C&C for better chances of bypassing firewalls (looks like HTTP and I can use any protocol).
    Certificate is validated client side, to prevent MITM.
    Use multiple valid certificates, each IP range gets a different one to prevent blacklisting.
    I would also have multiple front ends, the client would try to connect to some of them (each client has multiple front end hardcoded).
    The client polls for new commands every  hour, the time can be changed at polling time, the binary updated, IPS and certificates changed.
    Every time connect to a differnet front end to not look suspicious.
    Use TOR hidden services, generate unique domains for every binary.


Securing a new Linux host or 10,000 new Linux hosts
    Disk encryption
    SSH only with a private key, unique per machine per user.
    make sure kernel and packages is  updated
    SELinux with enforcing poly, restricts how apps can interact with kernel, for example file system objects are identified by path name rather tha inode, to prevent symlink attacks to files that would not normally be accessabke
    Disable USB usage
    Lock screen
    Lockdown SSH with a PKI
    Setup your IPTABLES/firewall
    Review log files daily.

1. Planning and preparation
    Identification of contact individuals from both side,
    Opening meeting to confirm the scope, approach, and methodology, and
    Agree to specific test cases and escalation paths.

2. Assessment
    Information Gathering: Using the Internet to find all information about the target, using both technical and nontechnical methods.
    Network Mapping: Identifying all systems and resources within the target network.
    Vulnerability Identification: Activities performed by the assessor to detect vulnerabilities in the target.
    Penetration: Gaining unauthorized access by circumventing the security measures in place and trying to reach as wide a level of access as possible.
    Gaining Access and Privilege Escalation: After successfully exploiting a target system or network, the assessor will try to gain higher level privileges.
    Enumerating Further: Obtaining additional information about processes on the system, with the goal of further exploiting a compromised network or system.
    Compromise Remote Users/Sites: Exploit the trust relationships and communication between remote users and enterprise networks.
    Maintaining Access: Using covert channels, back doors, and rootkits to hide the assessorâ€™s presence on the system or to provide continual access to the compromised system.
    Covering Tracks: Eliminate all signs of compromise by hiding files, clearing logs, defeating integrity checks, and defeating antivirus software.
