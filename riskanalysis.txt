    Identity and Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability
        Identity and Authentication: Proving an identity claim
        Authorization: Describes the actions you can perform on a system once you have identified and authenticated.
        Accountability: holds users accountable for their actions. This is typically done by logging and analyzing audit data.
        Non-repudiation: It means a user cannot deny (repudiate) having performed a transaction. It combines authentication and integrity: non-repudiation authenticates the identity of a user who performs a transaction, and ensures the integrity of that transaction

    Least Privilege and Need to Know
        Least privilege means users should be granted the minimum amount of access
        (authorization) required to do their jobs, but no more
        Need to know means Sebastian can access a patient’s record only if he has a
        business need to do so.

    Defense-in-Depth
        Defense-in-Depth (also called layered defenses) applies multiple safeguards (also
    called controls: measures taken to reduce risk) to protect an asset. Any one security
    control may fail; by deploying multiple controls, you improve the confidentiality,
    integrity, and availability of your data.

Thread modeling
    Step 1: Decompose the application into use-cases (DFD) of how the application interacts with external entities to understand attack surface.
    Step 2: Determine and rank threats to those DFD, using STRIDE or Attack trees, etc..
    Step 3: Determine countermeasures and mitigation

    STRIDE
        Spoofing of user identity
        Tampering
        Repudiation
        Information disclosure (privacy breach or data leak)
        Denial of service (D.o.S)
        Elevation of privilege

    DREAD is a classification scheme for quantifying, comparing and prioritizing the amount of risk presented by each evaluated threat. The DREAD acronym is formed from the first letter of each category below.

    DREAD modeling influences the thinking behind setting the risk rating, and is also used directly to sort the risks. The DREAD algorithm, shown below, is used to compute a risk value, which is an average of all five categories.

    Risk_DREAD = (DAMAGE + REPRODUCIBILITY + EXPLOITABILITY + AFFECTED USERS + DISCOVERABILITY) / 5

    To understand the practical risks to a system, you might model threats by considering the following:
        Individual system components: Exploitable vulnerabilities can exist within infrastructure (e.g., hypervisors, software switches, storage nodes, and load balancers), operating systems, server software, client applications, and end users themselves

        Goals of the attacker: Data exposure or modification, Elevation of privilege, Arbitrary code execution
        Denial of service
        Exposed system components (the available attack surface) remote access / physical access
        Economic cost and feasibility of each attack vector

Risk Analysis
    **Asset** is valuable resources for the business to protect.
    **Threat** is an action or inaction that could cause harmful occurrence to assets (accidental or deliberate).
    **Threat agents** intentionally exploit vulnerabilities.
    **Threat events** are accidental exploitations of vulnerabilities (fire, earthquake).
    **Impact** is the result of having a vulnerability exploited by a threat.
    **Risk** is the possibility that a threat will exploit a vulnerability to cause harm to an asset.
    **Exposure** is being susceptible to asset loss due to a threat; there is the possibility that a vulnerability can or will be exploited by a threat agent or event.
    **Safeguard/countermeasure** is anything that removes a vulnerability or protects against one or more specific threats.
    **Attack** is the exploitation of a vulnerability by a threat agent.
    **Breach** is the occurrence of a security mechanism being bypassed or thwarted by a threat agent.
    **Vulnerability** is a weakness that allows a threat to cause harm.

    **Risk =Threat * Vulnerability * Impact**

Calculating Annualized Loss Expectancy

    Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) calculation allows you to determine the
    annual cost of a loss due to a risk. Once calculated, ALE allows you to make
    informed decisions to mitigate the risk.

    Asset value (AV) is the value of the asset you are trying to protect. In this
    example, each laptop costs $2500


    The Exposure Factor (EF) is the percentage of value an asset lost due to an incident.
    In the case of a stolen laptop with unencrypted PII, the Exposure Factor is
    100%:

    The Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) is the cost of a single loss. SLE is the Asset
    Value (AV) times the Exposure Factor (EF). In our case, SLE is $25,000 (Asset
    Value) times 100% (Exposure Factor), or $25,000.

    The Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) is the number of losses you suffer per year.
    Looking through past events, you discover that you have suffered 11 lost or stolen
    laptops per year on average. Your ARO is 11.

    The Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is your yearly cost due to a risk. It is calculated
    by multiplying the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) times the Annual Rate of
    Occurrence (ARO). In our case, it is $25,000 (SLE) times 11 (ARO), or $275,000.

    The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is the total cost of a mitigating safeguard.


    Return on Investment (ROI) is the amount of money saved by implementing a
    safeguard. If your annual Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is less than your Annualized
    Loss Expectancy (ALE), you have a positive ROI (and have made a good
    choice). If the TCO is higher than your ALE, you have made a poor choice

        Mitigate
        Transfer (insurance)

    Quantitative and Qualitative Risk Analysis
        Quantitative Risk Analysis uses hard metrics, such as dollars.
        Qualitative Risk Analysis uses simple approximate values.
        Calculating the Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is an example of Quantitative
    Risk Analysis.
