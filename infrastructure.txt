Disks layouts
    RAID 0
        Data evenly splitted accross disks.
        No fault tolerance or redundancy.
        RAID 0 of n drives provide read/write n times quicker.

    RAID 1
        An exact copy in two drives.
        Good read performance.
        Write speed as slow as the slowest disk.

    RAID 2
        bit-level stripping, not used nowadays.

    RAID 3
        byte-level stripping, not used.

    RAID 4
        block-level stripping, not used.

    RAID 5
        block level stripping, parity information distribute among the drives.
        If one drive fails, the others can reconstruct the data based on the parity.

    RAID 5
        block level stripping, doubleparity information distribute among the drives.
        If two drives fail, the others can reconstruct the data based on the parity.

Internet addresses

    32 bits per IPv4 address

    Each IP is broken into four 8 bit blocks or octets

    11111111 = 255
    00000000 = 0
