*Infrastructure*
CPU
    **Scalar processors** execute one instruction per cycle (Rpi 1).
    **In-order superscalar processor** can ran multiple instructions that have no dependencies at the same time.
    **Out-of-order processor** can re-order instructions that have no dependencies to keep the pipes busy (Pentium 2, modern cortex).
    **branch prediction** is a complex CPU component that predicts which conditional branch will be taken to improve performance. It is a very complex mechanism that is trained at runtime. An attacker can miss-train it to take bad decisions.
    **Speculative execution** will execute instructions that are not needed to keep pipes busy.
    **Caching** uses temporal locality and spatial locality to store data that will likely be used soon.
Disks layouts
    RAID 0
        Data evenly splitted accross disks.
        No fault tolerance or redundancy.
        RAID 0 of n drives provide read/write n times quicker.

    RAID 1
        An exact copy in two drives.
        Good read performance.
        Write speed as slow as the slowest disk.

    RAID 2
        bit-level stripping, not used nowadays.

    RAID 3
        byte-level stripping, not used.

    RAID 4
        block-level stripping, not used.

    RAID 5
        block level stripping, parity information distribute among the drives.
        If one drive fails, the others can reconstruct the data based on the parity.

    RAID 5
        block level stripping, doubleparity information distribute among the drives.
        If two drives fail, the others can reconstruct the data based on the parity.

Internet addresses

    32 bits per IPv4 address

    Each IP is broken into four 8 bit blocks or octets

    Ip ranges
    *A 0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255
